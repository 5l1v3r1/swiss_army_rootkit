These are 2 scripts that will help you test the ipv4/ipv6 connections.

Requirements:
	* Allow  port redirection on the virtual machine:
		-> add these lines to the Makefile
				-redir tcp:3000::3000\
				-redir tcp:3001::3001\
				-redir udp:3002::3002\
				-redir udp:3003::3003\

	* Install nmap on the virtual machine
		apt-get install nmap

Contents:
	* ncat_sv
		-> must be copied to the virtual machine and run
	* ncat_cl
		-> stays on the client machine and is run after ncat_sv

Usage:
	* run the ncat_sv on the virtual machine, it will open 4 ncat servers
	that listen by default on ports 3000/3001/3002/3003
	* run the ncat_cl on the client and write something in the window, you
	should get what you wrote back

The ipv6 connections to the virtual machine don't work on my machine, I'm not
sure why. Spawsning the server works ok, but when trying to connect all ipv6
connections fail. You can test the from inside the virtual machine, after you
start the servers by running
	ncat -6 -u ::1 $port

	-u is for udp, if the connection is tcp omit it
