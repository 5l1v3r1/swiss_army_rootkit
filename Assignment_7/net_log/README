This should be a decent implementation of the netlog keylogger
(it works, but it's not polished yet)

When inserted it should send all stdin data as udp packets over the
network to the IP that is hardcoded in the netlogger_init function.
Replace your IP there.

You also need to have some syslog server running, I used syslog-ng.

For some API hints see [2].
